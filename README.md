Homework 1 - Using semantic HTML and condensing CSS
<h4> *We were given starter code. The task was to make the starter code easier to read, WITHOUT changing how the site looked when launched. 
<br>
<p>*I did this by using semantic HTML elements to organize the header, body, and footer. </p>
<br>
<p>*Next I edited my CSS selectors to match the HTML elements.</p>
<br>
<p>* I then grouped the classes in CSS (with the same targeted attributes)together to condense the CSS code.
<br>
<p>* I then included alt tags and image descriptions for the the images.</p>
<br>
<p>Finally, I checked to see if the page launched and looked like the mock up page.</h4>
